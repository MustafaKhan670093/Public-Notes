# Software Interview Questions

<b>Note:</b> The following questions were originally compiled by a group known as [Developers Cosmos](https://github.com/developers-cosmos).
<b>1.What is Software Testing?</b><br>
Software Testing is evaluation of the software against requirements gathered from users and system specifications. Testing is conducted at the phase level in software development life cycle or at module level in program code. Software testing comprises of Validation and Verification.<br>

<b>2.What is Test Case?</b><br>
Test Case is a commonly used term for a specific test. This is usually the smallest unit of testing. A
Test Case will consist of information such as requirements testing, test steps, verification steps,
prerequisites, outputs, test environment, etc. A set of inputs, execution preconditions, and expected
outcomes developed for a particular objective, such as to exercise a particular program path or to
verify compliance with a specific requirement.<br>

<b>3.What is Test Plan?</b><br>
A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended testing activities. It
identifies test items, the features to be tested, the testing tasks, who will do each task, and any risks
requiring contingency planning.<br>

<b>4.What is Test Procedure?</b><br>
A document providing detailed instructions for the execution of one or more test cases is called test
Procedure. 

<b>5.What is Test Script?</b><br>
Test script is commonly used to refer to the instructions for a particular test that will be carried out by
an automated test tool. 

<b>6.What is Test Specification?</b><br>
Test specification is a document specifying the test approach for a software feature or combination or
features and the inputs, predicted results and execution conditions for the associated tests. 

<b>7.What is Test tool?</b><br>
Computer programs used for the testing of a system, a component of the system, or its
documentation is called a test tool.

<b>8.What is a Bug?</b><br>
When actual result deviates from the expected result while testing a software application or product
then it results into a defect. Hence, any deviation from the specification mentioned in the product
functional specification document is a defect. In different organizations it’s called a Bug. 

<b>9.What is Defect?</b><br>
If software misses some feature or function from what is there in requirement it is called as defect.

<b>10.What is Capability maturity model?</b><br>
The Capability Maturity Model for Software (CMM or SW-CMM) is a model for judging the maturity of
the software processes of an organization and for identifying the key practices that are required to
increase the maturity of these processes. 

<b>11.What is Beta Testing?</b><br>
Beta testing is testing of a release of a software product conducted by customers.

<b>12.What is Black box Testing?</b><br>
Testing based on an analysis of the specification of a piece of software without reference to its
internal workings. The goal is to test how well the component conforms to the published requirements
for the component.

<b>13.What is White box Testing></b><br>
Testing based on an analysis of internal workings and structure of a piece of software. This includes
techniques such as Branch Testing and Path Testing. This also known as Structural Testing and
Glass Box Testing. Contrast with Black Box Testing. White box testing is used to test the internal logic
of the code for ex checking whether the path has been executed once, checking whether the
branches has been executed at least once .This is used to check the structure of the code.

<b>14.What is Boundary Testing?</b><br>
Test which focus on the boundary or limit conditions of the software being tested. (Some of these
tests are stress tests).

<b>15.What is Boundary Analysis?</b><br>
BVA is similar to Equivalence Partitioning but focuses on "corner cases" or values that are usually out
of range as defined by the specification. This means that if a function expects all values in range of
negative 100 to positive 1000, test inputs would include negative 101 and positive 1001.

<b>16.What is Coidng?</b><br>
The generation of source code is called Coding. 

<b>17.What is Compatability Testing?</b><br>
Testing whether software is compatible with other elements of a system with which it should operate.<br>
e.g. browsers, Operating Systems, or hardware.

<b>18.What is Ad Hoc Testing?</b><br>
A testing phase where the tester tries to 'break' the system by randomly trying the system's
functionality is called Ad Hoc testing. This can include negative testing also.

<b>19.What is Agile Testing?</b><br>
A testing phase where the tester tries to 'break' the system by randomly trying the system's
functionality is called Ad Hoc testing. This can include negative testing also.

<b>20.What is Automated Testing?</b><br>
Testing employing software tools which execute tests without manual intervention is called Automated
Testing. Can be applied in GUI, performance, API, etc. testing. The use of software to control the
execution of tests, the comparison of actual outcomes to predicted outcomes, the setting up of test
preconditions, and other test control and test reporting functions. 

<b>21.What is Debugging?</b><br>
The process of finding and removing the causes of software failures is called Debugging. 

<b>22.What is Data flow diagram?</b><br>
A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data through an information
system, modelling its process aspects. 

<b>23.What is Dependency Testing?</b><br>
Dependency Testing, a testing technique in which an application's requirements are pre-examined
for an existing software, initial states in order to test the proper functionality. The impacted areas of
the application are also tested when testing the new features or existing features. 

<b>24.What is Functional Testing?</b><br>
Testing the features and operational behaviour of a product to ensure they correspond to its
specifications. Testing that ignores the internal mechanism of a system or component and focuses
solely on the outputs generated in response to selected inputs and execution conditions. or Black Box
Testing. 

<b>25.What is Regression Testing?</b><br>
Retesting a previously tested program following modification to ensure that faults have not been
introduced or uncovered as a result of the changes made is called Regression testing. 

<b>26.What is Sanity Testing?</b><br>
Brief test of major functional elements of a piece of software to determine if its basically operational.
See also Smoke Testing.

<b>27.What is smoke Testing?</b><br>
In Software testing context, smoke testing refers to testing the basic functionality of the build.

<b>28.What is System Testing?</b><br>
Testing that attempts to discover defects that are properties of the entire system rather than of its
individual components is called System testing. 

<b>29.Differences between Quality assurance and Testing?</b><br>
Quality assurance involves the entire software development process and testing involves operation of
a system or application to evaluate the results under certain conditions. QA is oriented to prevention
and Testing is oriented to detection.

<b>30.Why does Software has bugs?</b><br>
Software have bugs because of the following reasons: 1) Miscommunication 2) programming errors 3)
time pressures. 4) Changing requirements 5) software complexity .

<b>31.What is Usecase?</b></br>
Use case is the specification of tests that are conducted from the end-user perspective. Use cases
tend to focus on operating software as an end-user would conduct their day-to-day activities. 

<b>32.What is Unit Testing?</b><br>
Testing of individual software components is called Unit testing.

<b>33.How does Client/server method affects Testing?</b><br>
Client/server applications can be quite complex due to the multiple dependencies among clients, data
communications, hardware, and servers. Thus testing requirements can be extensive. When time is
limited (as it usually is) the focus should be on integration and system testing. Additionally,
load/stress/performance testing may be useful in determining client/server application limitations and
capabilities. There are commercial tools to assist with such testing. 

<b>34.Differences between White box and Black box Testing?</b><br>
Black-box and white-box are test design methods. Black-box test design treats the system as a
“black-box”, so it doesn't explicitly use knowledge of the internal structure. Black-box test design is
usually described as focusing on testing functional requirements. Synonyms for black-box include:
behavioural, functional, opaque-box, and closed-box. White-box test design allows one to peek inside
the “box”, and it focuses specifically on using internal knowledge of the software to guide the selection
of test data. Synonyms for white-box include: structural, glass-box and clear-box. While black-box and
white-box are terms that are still in popular use, many people prefer the terms 'behavioural' and
'structural'. Behavioural test design is slightly different from black-box test design because the use of
internal knowledge isn't strictly forbidden, but it's still discouraged. In practice, it hasn't proven useful
to use a single test design method. One has to use a mixture of different methods so that they aren't
hindered by the limitations of a particular one. Some call this 'gray-box' or 'translucent-box' test
design, but others wish we'd stop talking about boxes altogether. It is important to understand that
these methods are used during the test design phase, and their influence is hard to see in the tests
once they're implemented. Note that any level of testing (unit testing, system testing, etc.) can use
any test design methods. Unit testing is usually associated with structural test design, but this is
because testers usually don't have well-defined requirements at the unit level to validate. 

<b>35.How do you plan Test Automation?</b><br>
1)Prepare the automation Test plan 2) Identify the scenario 3) Record the scenario 4) Enhance the
scripts by inserting check points and Conditional Loops 5) Incorporated Error Handler 6) Debug the
script 7) Fix the issue 8) Rerun the script and report the result. 

<b>36.Does Automation replace Manual Testing?</b><br>
There can be some functionality which cannot be tested in an automated tool so we may have to do it
manually. Therefore manual testing can never be replaced. (We can write the scripts for negative
testing also but it is hectic task).When we talk about real environment we do negative testing
manually.

<b>37.how will you choose a tool for Test Automation?</b><br>
Choosing of a tool depends on many things like 1) Application to be tested 2) Test environment 3)
Scope and limitation of the tool. 4) Feature of the tool 5) Cost of the tool 6) Whether the tool is
compatible with your application which means tool should be able to interact with your application 7)
Ease of use .

<b>38.Describe common problems of Test Automation?</b><br>
The common problems are: 1. Maintenance of the old script when there is a feature change or
enhancement 2. The change in technology of the application will affect the old scripts .


<b>39.Describe main Attributes of test Automation</b><br>
Maintainability, Reliability, Flexibility, Efficiency, Portability, Robustness, and Usability - these are the
main attributes in test automation.

<b>40.How to test Web application?</b><br>
The basic difference in web testing is here we have to test for URL's coverage and links coverage.
Using Win Runner we can conduct web testing. But we have to make sure that Web test option is
selected in "Add in Manager". Using WR we cannot test XML objects.

<b>46.What is Regression Testing?</b><br>
REGRESSION TESTING is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features. Regression Testing is nothing but a full or partial selection of already executed test cases which are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work fine.<br>or <br>

<b>47.What is Exploratory Testing?</b><br>
EXPLORATORY TESTING is a type of software testing where Test cases are not created in advance but testers check system on the fly. They may note down ideas about what to test before test execution.

<b>48.What is Soak Testing?</b><br>
Running a system at high load for a prolonged period of time is called Soak testing. For example; run
several times more transactions in an entire day (or night) than would be expected in a busy day, to
identify the performance problems that appear after a large number of transactions have been
executed.

<b>49.What are Memory leak and buffer overflow?</b><br>
Memory leaks means incomplete de-allocation - are bugs that happen very often. Buffer overflow
means data sent as input to the server that overflows the boundaries of the input area, thus causing
the server to misbehave.

<b>50.What is Exhaustive Testing?</b><br>
Testing which covers all combinations of input values and preconditions for an element of the
software under test.
